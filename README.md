## About

The **Contour Alignment Tool** is a MATLAB-based application designed for aligning 3D structure contours with 2D kilovoltage projections.

### Key Features:
- Load projections along with CT, structure set, and treatment plan files.
- Visualise and manually align 2D contours generated from 3D structures.
- Export aligned contours as binary masks for machine learning applications.
- Supports a wide range of 2D projection formats.

### Installation

1. Download the latest release:  
   [ContourAlignmentTool v1.3.6](https://github.com/Image-X-Institute/contour-alignment-tool/releases/download/v1.3.6/ContourAlignmentTool-v1.3.6.zip)
2. Extract contents to a local directory.

### Data

Required data types:
- CT DICOMs
- Structure DICOM
- Plan DICOM
- Kilovoltage images (`.tiff`, `.xim`, `.hnd`, `.hnc`, `.his`)

> Sample data is available from the [SPARK Database](https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/31090).

## Usage

### Loading Data

1. **Launch the application** by running the `ContourAlignmentTool.exe`.  
   > ⏳ It may take several minutes to load depending on the system.

2. **Load data** via:
   - **Clinical Data Browse**: Load entire patient datasets.
   - **Individual Browse**: Manually select CT, plan, structure, and image files.

   ![Data Loading](ContourAlignmentTool_resources/instruction-PatientPlanLoad.png)

3. **Set parameters**:
   - Number of projections
   - Pixel spacing
   - SID, SDD, detector offset (if not found in headers)

   ![Parameter Setup](https://github.com/Image-X-Institute/contour-alignment-tool/assets/63682590/056855ba-4241-4db8-9f68-d51157f54e7f)

4. **Select the Structure of Interest** from the dropdown.

5. Click **Proceed** to begin processing (execution time varies).

6. After processing, begin **labelling** and alignment:

### Contour Alignment

#### Navigation

- Use on-screen navigation buttons or arrow keys to switch projections.
- Click any projection from the list to jump to it.

#### Moving Contours

- Use:
  - Arrow keys / UI buttons
  - Mouse drag
- Reset with the center reset button.

#### Confidence Selection

- Mark each projection's alignment confidence for tracking.

---

### Display Options

Located under the **Display** menu:

- **DRR Viewer**: Shows full DRR view with true contour locations.
- **Contour Fill**: Switch between filled or border display.
- **Contour Colour**: Set custom contour colours.
- **Invert Intensity**: Toggle image intensity inversion.

#### Contrast Adjustment

- Use sliders to manually adjust contrast.
- Additional tools for:
  - Auto adjust
  - ROI-based adjust
  - Contour-based adjust

---

### Data Export

- Navigate to `File` → `Export` or `Export As...`:
  - **Export**: Saves to the default or previously set directory.
  - **Export As...**: Choose a new export location.

Outputs are binary PNG masks aligned with each projection.

## Build

To modify or build the tool, use **MATLAB App Designer**.

Project files:
- `ContourAlignmentTool.mlapp` — main application file.
- `ContourAlignmentTool.prj` — packaging project config.
